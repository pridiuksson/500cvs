# Ideas for Future Improvements

This document contains ideas for improving the AI-Powered CV Screening Application. These are not critical for the initial build, but they would improve the quality, scalability, and maintainability of the project.

## Agent Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Role Matrix:** Create a role matrix that clearly outlines the responsibilities of each agent (e.g., Job Parser Agent, Content Generator Agent, Formatter Agent).
*   **Visual Diagram:** Include a visual diagram or pseudocode showing how agents interact.

## Edge Case Handling

*   **Incomplete Data:** Add explicit handling for edge cases like incomplete job descriptions or missing metadata.
*   **Inference:** If metadata is missing, infer it based on other inputs or prompt for clarification.

## AI Model Usage

*   **Prompt Templates:** Provide prompt templates for AI models to improve the quality and consistency of the generated content.
*   **Post-processing:** Include guidelines for post-processing model outputs (e.g., cleaning up redundant text, ensuring consistency).

## Validation and Testing

*   **Validation Pipeline:** Define a validation pipeline to evaluate the quality of the generated CVs (e.g., using an ATS simulator).
*   **Success Metrics:** Specify success metrics and thresholds for validation (e.g., 90% match rate).
*   **Test Coverage:** Define test coverage expectations (e.g., 80%+).
*   **Test Types:** Specify the types of tests to be written (e.g., unit, integration, e2e).

## Scalability and Performance

*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Use asynchronous processing to handle multiple CVs in parallel.
*   **Caching:** Cache intermediate results to avoid redundant computations.
*   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor resource usage during batch processing.

## Long-Term Maintenance

*   **Periodic Reviews:** Schedule periodic reviews of AI models and libraries to ensure compatibility.
*   **Retraining:** Plan for retraining models with new data as job markets evolve.

## API and Error Handling

*   **Error Response Standards:** Define a standard JSON format for error responses.
*   **HTTP Status Codes:** Use appropriate HTTP status codes for different types of errors.
*   **CORS Configuration:** Specify CORS configuration for the backend.

## Deployment and Infrastructure

*   **Docker Configuration:** Provide Docker configuration for the application.
*   **Port Configurations:** Specify port configurations for the frontend and backend.
*   **Static File Serving:** Provide guidance on serving static files for the React build.
